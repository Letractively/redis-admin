* Known limitations *

_1.1 Can I use any Sorted Sets commands?_

No, Sorted Sets is not supported yet.

_1.2 What is Schemas?_

Redis do not use the Schemas concept. Redis uses DB instances (0, 1, 2, 3 ... 15). So, to organize this instances and make more easy for human, we created an alias to them. These alias are Schemas.
